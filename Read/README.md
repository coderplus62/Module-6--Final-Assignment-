### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

```python
# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

```

```python
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print(f'{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours')
# output: 200 minutes is equal to 3.3333333333333335 hours
```
